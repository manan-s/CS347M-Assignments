#Assignment 2: Simulating various scheduling algorithms

Instructions on running: 
1) Ensure your system supports makefile
2) Run following two commands

$ make
.....
.....
.....
$ ./sched 

You need to then enter the number of processes (a positive number)
After this you'll be prompted to give data for each process
Data per process includes ID, Burst time and Arrival time
Once you enter data for all processes, you can choose to run any of the 4 schedulers or exit
If you choose any scheduler other than Lottery scheduler, you'll get the results directly
If you choose lottery scheduler, you need to give a quantum size (a positive number), and ticket values for each process (all positive)
